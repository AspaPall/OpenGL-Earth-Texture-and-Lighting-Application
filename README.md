# OpenGL Earth Texture and Lighting Application

This repository contains the source code for an OpenGL application developed as part of an MSc exercise. The application demonstrates the use of textures and lighting on a 3D sphere, specifically applying an Earth texture to the sphere. It utilizes OpenGL shaders (both vertex and fragment shaders), and an .obj file for the 3D model of the sphere. The .obj file contains indices for vertices, normals, and texture coordinates, which are handled by a Mesh class (meshvft) to properly render the textured sphere with lighting effects.
